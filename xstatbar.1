.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays an overview of basic system information (CPU usage, etc.), and
additional information that is usefull on many laptops such as volume,
battery life, and more.  The display tries to be as minimal as possible,
while still providing a good overview of things.
.Pp
The window that
.Nm
uses is not part of any tab-order by most window managers, has no
decorations, and will persist across multiple workspaces.
.Pp
The information displayed by
.Nm
is:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
For each CPU, a graph of the last 60 seconds of usage followed by the current
breakdown, similar to what you find in
.Xr top 1 .
.It
A graph of memory usage for the last 60 seconds, followed by the current
breakdown, again, similar to what is found in
.Xr top 1 .
.It
Swap usage (no graph).  This is shown only if any swapping is currently
taking place.
.It
Number of active and total processes.
.It
Power information, including if AC is the current source, or the BATtery,
followed by a graph of the estimated remaining power, and an estimate of
the amount of time (in minutes) remaining before the battery is drained.
.It
Left and right volume levels, including graphs.
.It
Current date and time.
.El
.Pp
Note that the above stats are displayed in the order listed, from left to
right, with the exception of the date and time.  That is displayed
right-justified in the display.
.Sh OPTIONS
Please note that
.Nm
is not highly configurable.  Only basics about the display (window position,
size, and font used) are configurable.  For anything more complicated, simply
edit the source.
.Pp
The following options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl b Ar width
Inner border width, in pixels.
.Pp
The default is 0.
.It Fl x Ar offset
The x coordinate, in pixels, of the upper-left corner of the window.
.Pp
The default is 0.
.It Fl y Ar offset
The y coordinate, in pixels, of the upper-left corner of the window.
.Pp
The default is 0.
.It Fl w Ar width
The width of the window to use, specified in pixels.  Only use this if you
want to limit
.Nm 's
display even further.
.Pp
The default is screen width.
.It Fl h Ar height
The width of the window to use, specified in pixels.
.Pp
The default is 13.
.It Fl f Ar font
Specify the font to use when displaying any text.  The default is whatever
"fixed" defaults to through
.Xr XLoadQueryFont 3 .
.It Fl s Ar seconds
The number of seconds to sleep between updating the stats displayed.
.Pp
The default is 1.
.It Fl t Ar time-format
Specify the format for the time to be displayed in.  Any string acceptable by
.Xr strftime 3
is acceptable.
.Pp
The default format is
.Dq "%a %d %b %Y %I:%M:%S %p"
.It Fl T
Use the default format for displaying the time but with a 24-hour format.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To display
.Nm
at the bottom of your display, assuming a 1280x800 display, use something
like the following:
.Pp
.Dl $ xstatbar -y 785
.Pp
If you are using a window manager such as
.Xr scrotwm 1 ,
you can then setup that region of your screen as "off-limits" for windows to
be placed, by adding the following to your
.Xr scrotwm 1
configuration:
.Pp
.Dl region = screen[1]:1280x785+0+0
.Pp
This instructs
.Xr scrotwm 1
to use only the region specified (for the default screen in multi-head setups)
for all other windows.  Note that 15 pixels are "removed" from the bottom of
the display, and this is where
.Nm
would be displayed.
